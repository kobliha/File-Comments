File-Comments
=============

The ideas is quite simple. There are plenty of files on a Linux filesystem,
many of them are owned by some RPM but some aren't. Additionally, some files
are re-generated from scratch on a service restart, etc.

I'd like to create a database of coments that could be used by any tool,
e.g. to identify that "I was here", this is my file, etc. We usually write
comments directly to files but as the files get re-generated, the info is
lost. Moreover there are plenty of files that don't allow comments, some
file formats allow comments, but not in a unified way.

This project should unify the approach to add, edit, and remove a file
comment (or rather comments) independently on a file type and selected
filesystem.
